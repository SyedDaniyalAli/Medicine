    "treatments" : "SYMPTOMS:                                     The symptoms of brain tumors depend on their size, type, and location. The most common symptoms of brain tumors include headaches; numbness or tingling in the arms or legs; seizures, memory problems; mood and personality changes; balance and walking problems; nausea and vomiting; changes in speech, vision, or hearing.                                     TREATMENT:                                         Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are the major treatment categories for most brain cancers. Individual treatment plans often include a combination of these treatments. Surgical therapy attempts to remove all of the tumor cells by cutting the tumor away from normal brain tissue. This surgery is often termed invasive surgery to distinguish it from noninvasive radiosurgery or radiation therapy described below. Some brain cancers are termed inoperable by surgeons because attempting to remove the cancer may cause further brain damage or death. However, a brain cancer termed inoperable by one surgeon may be considered operable by another surgeon. Patients with a diagnosis of an inoperable brain tumor should consider seeking a second opinion before surgical treatment is abandoned.",

The child's condition often gets much better within 24 hours of treatment with IV gamma globulin.High-dose aspirin is often given along with IV gamma globulin.Even with standard treatment, up to 1 in 4 children may still develop problems in their coronary arteries. Some research suggests that adding steroids or TNF inhibitors such as Enbrel to the treatment routine may help. However, there still needs to be better tests to tell which children will benefit from added forms of treatment.",

TREATMENT:                                         Omphaloceles are repaired with surgery, although not always immediately. A sac protects the abdominal contents and allows time for other more serious problems (such as heart defects) to be dealt with first, if necessary.To fix an omphalocele, the sac is covered with a special man-made material, which is then stitched in place to form what is referred to as a “silo”.
